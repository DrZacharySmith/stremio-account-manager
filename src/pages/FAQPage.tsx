              This tool is designed for <strong>bulk Stremio account and addon management</strong>.
              It allows you to manage multiple Stremio accounts, install and remove addons across
              accounts, and sync configurations. This tool is{' '}
              <strong>not related to specific addons in any way, shape, or form</strong> - it is
              purely a management interface for your Stremio accounts and their addon

                Yes! This will allow you to move the Cinemeta provided catalogs (i.e., Popular -
                Series/Movie and Featured - Series/Movie) from the top of your catalog list.
              </p>

            <CardTitle>Why can't protected addons be removed?</CardTitle>
          </CardHeader>
          <CardContent>
            <div className="space-y-3 text-muted-foreground">
              <p>
                Protected addons are essential for Stremio's core functionality. For example,
                Cinemeta provides the metadata and catalog system that Stremio relies on. Removing
                these addons would break critical features of your Stremio profile, which is why
                they cannot be removed.
              </p>
              <p>
                <strong>However</strong>, for Cinemeta specifically, you can customize its behavior
                using the built-in configuration feature. Click the "Configure" button on the
                Cinemeta addon card to:
              </p>
              <ul className="list-disc list-inside space-y-1 ml-2">
                <li>Remove search artifacts (search catalogs and search functionality)</li>
                <li>Remove standard catalogs (Popular, New, Featured)</li>
                <li>Remove the metadata resource</li>
              </ul>
              <p>
                This allows you to reduce Cinemeta's presence without breaking Stremio's core
                functionality. You can always reset Cinemeta to its original configuration using the
                "Reset to Original" button in the configuration dialog.
              </p>
              <p>
                For other protected addons, a reasonable alternative is to move the addon to the
                bottom of the list; however, there could be unexpected issues with this approach,
                although these haven't been observed yet in normal usage.

                Your AuthKey is a unique identifier that allows this tool to access your Stremio
                account and manage your addons. You can retrieve it directly from your browser's
                local storage when you're logged into Stremio's web interface.
              </p>
              <p>
                <strong>Note:</strong> Using your username and password is the easier option (and
                what we personally recommend), as it doesn't require accessing the developer
                console. However, if you don't feel comfortable entering your password, you can use
                your AuthKey instead by following the instructions below.
